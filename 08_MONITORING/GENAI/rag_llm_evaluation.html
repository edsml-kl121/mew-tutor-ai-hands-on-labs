      <td>The text provides a tautological definition.  It defines AI as 'artificial intelligence', which doesn't explain what artificial intelligence actually is.  It then adds that it 'simulates human thinking,' which is a partial and potentially misleading description. A proper definition would require more detail about the underlying mechanisms, techniques (like machine learning, deep learning, etc.), and capabilities of AI.</td>

It mentions algorithms and data patterns, but doesn't explain how these elements interact, the types of algorithms used, the process of training, or any of the underlying mathematical concepts.  To truly answer 'How does machine learning work?', a much more detailed explanation is required.  The statement is too vague to be considered a valid answer.</td>

This is a true statement but it's far too brief to constitute an explanation of deep learning concepts.  A valid explanation would need to cover various aspects such as  types of neural networks used (CNNs, RNNs, etc.), activation functions, backpropagation, loss functions, optimization algorithms, and the difference between deep learning and other machine learning approaches. The provided text lacks sufficient detail to meet the question's requirement for an explanation.</td>
